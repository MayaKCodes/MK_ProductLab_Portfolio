Hi, I'm Maya and this is my product portfolio. 

I wanted my portoflio to display the diverse experiences and skills I've developed as a product manager, designer and digital strategist. I leverage a variety of html elements and templates to customize and build my site. I wanted my site to reflect my experiences as well as my personality. I opted for a vibrant color pallet with various interactive elements and animations to make my site engaging and unique!
